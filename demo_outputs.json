    "answer": "According to the documents, two advantages of transformers over RNNs (Recurrent Neural Architectures) are:\n\n1. Transformers require less training time than earlier recurrent neural architectures like LSTMs.\n2. They have no recurrent units, which allows for faster processing and more efficient use of computational resources.",
